This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#### load libraries 
#### load data
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-03-01')
stations <- tuesdata$stations
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
View(stations)

cali <- filter(stations, STATE == "CA")

View (cali)
```

```{r}
## install ggmaps package
install.packages("ggmap")
library(ggmap)
```

```{r}
## get california base map
calmap <- map_data("state","california") %>%
  select(lon = long, lat, group, id = subregion)
head(calmap)

ggplot(calmap, aes(lon, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", colour = "grey50") + 
  coord_quickmap()

```

```{r}
#### filtering out for only livestock stations
electric <- filter( cali, FUEL_TYPE_CODE == "ELEC")

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = calmap, aes(lon, lat, group = group), fill = "white", colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point( data = electric, mapping = aes(x=LONGDD , y=LATDD))
  

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
