This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggpmisc)
```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-03-15')

cran<- tuesdata$cran
bioc <- tuesdata$bioc
View(bioc)
unique(bioc$package)

packages <- unique(bioc$package)
frequency <- bioc %>% group_by(package) %>% tally ## creating counts of frequency
arrange(frequency,desc(n)) # sorting in descending order

mostfreq<- frequency[1:20,]# creating shortened list of top 20 most updated

mostfreq <- mostfreq %>%
  mutate(range= (ifelse(n > 300, 1 , ifelse(n > 150, 2,ifelse(n > 75, 3, 4)))))
View(mostfreq)

mostfreq$range<-as.character(mostfreq$range)

ggplot(mostfreq)+
geom_col( aes( x= package, y = n, fill = range))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c( "1" = "blue", "2" ="red", "3" = "purple", "4"= "pink"), labels = c("1" = ">300", "2" ="151-300", "3" = "75-150", "4"= "<75"))+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
  
  
  
  

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
